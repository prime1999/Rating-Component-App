## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Desktop-first workflow

### Continued development

I am thinking of updating it by next week in order for the app to have a input field for the user to type more about the feedback and be a to submit it for it to reflect in the tank you box

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.traversymedia.com) - One of Brad's 50 days vanilla javascript project helped me understand the functionality of the project for me to build it on my own and think of updating it.
